# Project.Centaur.3
My Third Data Analyst Project.

In This Project I Used Flipkart Dataset From Kaggle.

# My Story When I Demonstrate Problem Solving Skill 

This Is One Of Most Unique And A Bit Hard Project Because I Encounter Unique Problem, Lets Name The Problem *"Centaur"* .
The Dataset Only Got Some Dust, Cleaning Is Very Fast And Easy. I Thought It Will Be Easy, Cleaning And Visualize . *Until The Centaur Came Charging ...*

The Centaur Is : *When I Want To Visualize It, There Are Some Strange Data. Let's Say I Have A Client And The Client Told Me To Find In This Dataset Which Product Is Most Popular In The Dataset* , So The Client Can Buy Cheap Sell High , But The Client Want Most Popular Product To Have A Guarantee Customer That Will Buy It. To Find Most Popular Product, I Check The Average Rating List, And Sort It .. *BOOM* . And Job Done , All That I Need Is Take The Data Out And Visualize It.

Thats When I Got Curious And Check It, Like Why The Rating Is 5.0/Perfect Score  . Is This Product So Amazing And Cheap Or What

I Check The Product Name In Google And Research It. Its Just so-so . Maybe People Have Different Taste. I Also See Why Is This Product So Popular , Smth Like That

Finally, I Check Just How Many People Rate It...

There Are Products That Have 30k+ , 42k+ , 100k+ Rating Etc .  And There Are Products Only Have Rating Less Than 10. This 5.0 Product Has Less Rating Than 3. *ONLY 3 PEOPLE RATE IT!!!* CAN U BELIEVE IT!!!

I Almost Did A *GRAVE* Mistake , After That I Sort It By How Many People Rate It. There Are Many Products That Have Less Than 50 People Rate It.

That When I Think , Should I Put A Blind Eye Into This Or What

I Mean, *People May Just Forgot To Rate It But Buy It*, Or *People Did't Buy It But Rate It Since They Like It* , Or *NO ONE BUY IT AND RATE IT, THE ONE RATE IT IS THE SELLER HIMSELF!!!*

I Spend 2 Hours Beating The Centaur , I Didn't Ask Anyone Nor Did i Check Anyone Encounter The Same Problem As Mine.

I Just Spend Time Thinking Alone, *Because For Me This Is A Opportunity* TO Demonstrate My Problem Solving Skill 

I Think Of Many Solution:
1. Delete It
2. Only Took 20+ Rating,  Since In Google, 50+ People Rating Is Already Very Good. But For Me This Is Bad, Compare To 4.2 Average Rating  With 100k+ People Rate It.
3. Ignore It, *Maybe People, You Know... Just Forgot To Rate It. But Of Course , That Is Bad Decision . That Is Last Resort*
4. And Finally, *Why Not Just Take The Top 500 + Data, Since There Are Thousands Row* . And Make Calculation Of It.

And Done . *Phew*

I See My Past Dashboard And It Look Less Interesting So I Make An Improvement On It. Personally It Feel To Me Much More Good Than Before , But Of Course I Should Work To Improve It More
