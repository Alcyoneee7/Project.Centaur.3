# Project.Centaur.3
My Third Data Analyst Project.

In This Project I Used Flipkart Dataset From Kaggle.

Source File I Use: "Flipcart Products Data - Backup, Original"

# My Story When I Demonstrate Problem Solving Skill 

This Is One Of Most Unique And A Bit Hard Project Because I Encounter Unique Problem, Lets Name The Problem *"Centaur"* .
The Dataset Only Got Some Dust, Cleaning Is Very Fast And Easy. I Thought It Will Be Easy, Cleaning And Visualize . *Until The Centaur Came Charging ...*

The Centaur Is : *When I Want To Visualize It, There Are Some Strange Data. Let's Say I Have A Client And The Client Told Me To Find In This Dataset Which Product Is Most Popular In The Dataset* , So The Client Can Buy Cheap Sell High , But The Client Want Most Popular Product To Have A Guarantee Customer That Will Buy It. To Find Most Popular Product, I Check The Average Rating List, And Sort It .. *BOOM* . And Job Done , All That I Need Is Take The Data Out And Visualize It.

Thats When I Got Curious And Check It, Like Why The Rating Is 5.0/Perfect Score  . Is This Product So Amazing And Cheap Or What

I Check The Product Name In Google And Research It. Its Just so-so . Maybe People Have Different Taste. I Also See Why Is This Product So Popular , Smth Like That

Finally, I Check Just How Many People Rate It...

There Are Products That Have 30k+ , 42k+ , 100k+ Rating Etc .  And There Are Products Only Have Rating Less Than 10. This 5.0 Product Has Less Rating Than 3. *ONLY 2 PEOPLE RATE IT!!!* CAN U BELIEVE IT!!!

I Almost Did A *GRAVE* Mistake , After That I Sort It By How Many People Rate It. There Are Many Products That Have Less Than 50 People Rate It.

That When I Think , Should I Put A Blind Eye Into This Or What

I Mean, *People May Just Forgot To Rate It But Buy It*, Or *People Did't Buy It But Rate It Since They Like It* , Or *NO ONE BUY IT AND RATE IT, THE ONE RATE IT IS THE SELLER HIMSELF!!!*

I Spend 2 Hours Beating The Centaur , I Didn't Ask Anyone Nor Did i Check Anyone Encounter The Same Problem As Mine. *Because For Me This Is A Opportunity* TO Demonstrate My Problem Solving Skill 

# Solution

I Just Spend Time Thinking Alone And Done Research Like, Can U Rate A Product Without Buying It Or Must Really Buy The Products, 

I Think Of Many Solution:
1. Delete It
2. Only Took 20+ Rating,  Since In Google, 50+ People Rating Is Already Very Good. But For Me This Is Bad, Compare To 4.2 Average Rating  With 100k+ People Rate It.
3. Ignore It, *Maybe People, You Know... Just Forgot To Rate It. But Of Course , That Is Bad Decision . That Is Last Resort*
4. And Finally, *DEMONSTRATING MY PROBLEM SOLVING SKILL* Instead Of Beating The Centaur To Pass The Floor ,Why Not Just Get Past It, While Avoiding It. You Know Just Like In Game  .It Didn't State I Have To Beat The Centaur To Past It.  Rather Than Take All Data Or Only Take 20+ People Ratings .*Take The Top 500 + Data, Since There Are Thousands Row* . And Make Calculation Of It. -- In SQL I Take Only 100 People Ratings Rather Than Top 500 Since I Remember Like, If The Client Want To Buy Low Sell High. They Only Choose Top 10 ...Smth Like That , Thats Why I Just Include It . Total 650+ Data From 1500+ Data Which Is Quite Good And The Top 10 Brand Didn't Have Less Than 100 Ratings

And Done . *Phew*

# Tableau

I See My Past Dashboard And It Look Less Interesting So I Make An Improvement On It. Personally It Feel To Me Much More Good Than Before , But Of Course I Should Work To Improve It More .* Better Little Improvement Then No Improvement*

# Summary

In This Project, Very Challenging Problem Is Encountered And Defeated By Me . I Got Some Knowledge And Insight From It. 

I Also Demonstrate My Skill In SQL Using Temp Table, I Want To Demonstrate My Recently Acquired Skill Which Is Join/Union ,But So Far I Didn't Find Any Data That Have Interesting Point OR Didn't Have Seperate Data


# Result

Also The Result Is In Tableau Public , Below Link: Flipcart Products Overview

# Summary

I Gained Much,The Only Hard Part Is The Centaur. After I Get Past It, It Have Been Smooth Sailing ^^. 

# Goal

In This Project , I Think Like You Know .. To Improve Myself. Choosing Which Dataset To Make As Project Is Tiresome.

Sometime There Are Interesting Dataset But It Is Easy Job. Not Challenging Like This Dataset Which Require Critical Thinking, Problem Solving Skill.

**I Seek Not Winning But Improvement**

So Yeah, I Will Learn Probably Web Scraping To Get My Own Data. So The Next Project Will Be Me Using Dataset That I Scrap Myself.

After Web Scraping, It Will Be Machine Learning, Advanced Data Analysis Technique.
